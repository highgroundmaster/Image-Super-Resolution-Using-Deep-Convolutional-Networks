### Dataset - Berkeley Segmentation Dataset 500 (BSDS500)
The dataset consists of 500 natural images, ground-truth human annotations and benchmarking code. The data is explicitly separated into disjoint train, validation and test subsets. The dataset is an extension of the BSDS300, where the original 300 images are used for training / validation and 200 fresh images, together with human annotations, are added for testing. Each image was segmented by five different subjects on average.
